## Introduction
* This project introduces a Web Based Appliaction system designed to predict laptop prices using supervised machine learning techniques. The study employs a random decision forest as the predictive model, achieving a precision of Lorem% in price estimation.

* In this approach, the random decision forest utilizes several independent variables to predict a single dependent variable: the laptop price. The model compares actual and predicted values to assess the accuracy of its predictions.

* The project proposes a method where the price of a laptop, the dependent variable, is forecasted based on factors such as the laptop Company,Type,Inches,Screen Resoution, RAM size, weight,storage type (HDD/SSD), GPU Brand, CPU Brand, IPS ,Operating System and whether it includes a touch screen.
