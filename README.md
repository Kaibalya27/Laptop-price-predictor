## Introduction
* This project introduces a Web Based Appliaction system designed to predict laptop prices using supervised machine learning techniques. The study employs a random decision forest as the predictive model, achieving a precision in price estimation.

* In this approach, the random decision forest utilizes several independent variables to predict a single dependent variable: the laptop price. The model compares actual and predicted values to assess the accuracy of its predictions.

* The project proposes a method where the price of a laptop, the dependent variable, is forecasted based on factors such as the laptop Company,Type,Inches,Screen Resoution, RAM size, weight,storage type (HDD/SSD), GPU Brand, CPU Brand, IPS ,Operating System and whether it includes a touch screen.

## Data Set
The dataset utilized in this project is 'laptop_data.csv', which includes details about laptop's different features such as brand, screen size, processor, RAM, storage, and price. It comprises 1303 rows and 12 columns. The dataset underwent significant data preprocessing, feature engineering,Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for analysis and for machine learning it utilizes random decision forest as the predictive model.
